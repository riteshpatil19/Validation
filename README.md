📝 Project Overview
This project is a React-based form validation application developed using functional components and React Hooks. The main objective of the project is to understand how form data is handled in React and how client-side validation can be implemented without reloading the page.

The application contains a user registration form with three input fields:
Email
Password
Confirm Password
The project ensures that the user enters valid and matching information before the form is successfully submitted.

⚙️ Technologies Used
React JS – For building user interfaces
JavaScript (ES6) – For logic and validation
HTML5 – For form structure
CSS3 – For styling the UI
Vite – For fast React project setup
